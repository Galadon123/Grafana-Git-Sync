# Tutorial 8: Kubernetes Integration

## Overview
Learn to checkpoint and restore Kubernetes pods, including multi-container pods, persistent volumes, and cluster-wide coordination.

## Prerequisites
- Completed tutorials 1-3 and 7 (Foundation + Container Basics)
- Kubernetes cluster access (minikube/kind acceptable)
- kubectl configured and working
- Understanding of pods, services, and volumes

## Key Concepts

### Pod Architecture
- **Multi-Container Pods**: Main containers, sidecars, and init containers
- **Shared Resources**: Network namespace, storage volumes, IPC
- **Pod Lifecycle**: Creation, running, termination phases

### Kubernetes-Specific Challenges
- **Pod Networking**: Cluster IP assignment and service discovery
- **Volume Management**: Persistent volumes, config maps, secrets
- **Resource Scheduling**: Node placement and resource allocation
- **Service Integration**: Load balancing and traffic routing

## What You'll Learn

### Pod Checkpoint Operations
- Identifying pods suitable for checkpointing
- Handling multi-container pod coordination
- Managing pod dependencies and relationships

### Volume and Storage Management
- **Persistent Volume Checkpointing**: Including storage state in checkpoints
- **ConfigMap and Secret Handling**: Managing configuration data
- **EmptyDir and HostPath**: Temporary and host-mounted storage

### Cluster Integration
- **Scheduler Coordination**: Working with Kubernetes scheduler
- **Network Policy Impact**: Understanding network restrictions
- **RBAC Considerations**: Required permissions for checkpoint operations

## Advanced Scenarios

### StatefulSet Management
- **Ordered Pod Checkpointing**: Maintaining stateful application order
- **Persistent Volume Claims**: Handling dynamic storage
- **Headless Services**: Managing pod-to-pod communication

### DaemonSet Considerations
- **Node-Specific Workloads**: Handling per-node applications
- **System Integration**: Managing system-level containers
- **Rolling Updates**: Checkpoint during update processes

### Multi-Namespace Operations
- **Cross-Namespace Dependencies**: Handling service dependencies
- **Resource Quotas**: Working within namespace limits
- **Network Policies**: Managing inter-namespace communication

## Production Considerations

### Cluster Stability
- **Resource Impact**: Checkpoint operations on cluster resources
- **Network Load**: Data transfer during pod migration
- **Storage I/O**: Impact on shared storage systems

### Application Coordination
- **Service Mesh Integration**: Handling sidecar containers (Istio, Linkerd)
- **Database Coordination**: Managing stateful data services
- **Message Queue State**: Preserving queue and subscription state

### Operational Workflow
- **Health Checks**: Verifying pod health after restore
- **Service Discovery Updates**: Ensuring traffic routing works
- **Monitoring Integration**: Maintaining observability during migration

## Integration Patterns

### Blue-Green Deployments
- Using checkpoints for deployment validation
- Quick rollback scenarios with preserved state
- Environment consistency maintenance

### Disaster Recovery
- Cross-cluster pod restoration
- Data center failover scenarios
- Geographic workload distribution

### Development and Testing
- Production-like environment creation
- Integration test environment setup
- Developer environment synchronization

## Limitations and Considerations

### Current Restrictions
- Not all pod types support checkpointing
- Complex networking configurations may have issues
- Some volume types cannot be checkpointed
- Cluster-specific resources may not transfer

### Planning Requirements
- Network topology understanding
- Storage architecture knowledge
- Application dependency mapping
- Performance impact assessment

This tutorial prepares you for enterprise-scale container orchestration and advanced migration scenarios in production Kubernetes environments.
