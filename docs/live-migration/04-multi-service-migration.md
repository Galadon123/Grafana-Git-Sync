# Multi-Service Migration

## What We'll Learn
How Cedana coordinates migration of complete application stacks including web applications, databases, and caching layers with dependency management.

## Core Concepts

Multi-service migration involves coordinating dependent services:
- **Dependency Ordering** - Database services before applications that use them
- **State Synchronization** - Coordinated checkpointing across all components
- **Network Connectivity** - Service discovery and inter-service communication
- **Data Consistency** - Maintaining data integrity across distributed state

## Service Stack Components

### Database Services
- **Transactional State** - Database transactions and connection state
- **Data Integrity** - Tables, indexes, and stored procedure state
- **Connection Pools** - Active database connections from applications
- **Replication State** - Master-slave relationship preservation

### Cache Layers
- **Memory State** - Redis/Memcached key-value data
- **Expiration Timers** - TTL values and scheduled expirations
- **Pub/Sub State** - Message queues and subscription state
- **Connection State** - Client connections and session data

### Application Tiers
- **Session State** - User sessions and authentication tokens
- **Connection Pools** - Connections to databases and external services
- **In-Memory Caches** - Application-level data caching
- **Request Context** - Active HTTP requests and processing state

## Migration Coordination

### Checkpoint Sequencing
- **Bottom-Up Approach** - Checkpoint dependencies first (database → cache → app)
- **State Consistency** - Ensure all services checkpoint at consistent points
- **Connection Draining** - Allow active connections to complete gracefully
- **Transaction Boundaries** - Checkpoint during transaction-safe periods

### Restore Sequencing
- **Dependency-First Restore** - Start services in correct dependency order
- **Readiness Validation** - Wait for each service to be ready before starting dependents
- **Connection Reestablishment** - Allow time for service connections to rebuild
- **Health Check Integration** - Verify service health before proceeding

## Real-World Patterns

### E-Commerce Platform
- PostgreSQL database with product and order data
- Redis cache for session management and product recommendations
- Python/Django web application serving customer requests
- Complete stack migration preserves shopping carts and user sessions

### Analytics Dashboard
- ClickHouse database with time-series metrics
- Redis for real-time data aggregation
- React frontend with WebSocket connections
- Migration maintains real-time data flow and dashboard state

### Microservices Architecture
- Multiple service containers with inter-service dependencies
- Service mesh coordination (Istio, Linkerd)
- Distributed tracing and monitoring context preservation
- Load balancer and ingress controller coordination
