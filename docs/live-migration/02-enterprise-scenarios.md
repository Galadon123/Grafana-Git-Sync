# Enterprise Migration Scenarios

## What We'll Learn
How Cedana handles complex enterprise environments including service mesh integration, multi-cluster operations, and industry-specific requirements.

## Core Concepts

Enterprise migration involves sophisticated coordination:
- **Service Dependencies** - Complex microservice relationships and state
- **Multi-Cluster Operations** - Cross-cluster and geographic distribution
- **Compliance Requirements** - Industry-specific regulatory needs
- **Disaster Recovery** - Business continuity and automated failover

## Enterprise Patterns

### Service Mesh Integration
- **Sidecar Management** - Istio-proxy and Envoy state preservation
- **Security Context** - Certificate and identity maintenance across migration
- **Traffic Policies** - Load balancing rules and routing preservation
- **Observability** - Distributed tracing context continuity

### Multi-Cluster Scenarios
- **Cross-Cluster Migration** - Workload movement between different clusters
- **Geographic Distribution** - Multi-region deployment coordination
- **Hybrid Cloud** - On-premises to cloud migration patterns
- **Infrastructure Updates** - Cluster upgrades using migration

## Industry Applications
