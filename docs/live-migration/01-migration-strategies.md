# Migration Strategy Implementation

## What We'll Learn
How to implement zero-downtime migration strategies using Cedana's pre-dump and page server capabilities.

## Core Concepts

Live migration minimizes service interruption by combining multiple Cedana techniques:
- **Pre-Dump Phases** - Transfer most data while service continues running
- **Quick Final Checkpoint** - Minimize actual downtime with incremental checkpoint
- **Infrastructure Coordination** - Coordinate with load balancers and monitoring
- **Graceful Cutover** - Switch traffic with minimal user impact

## Migration Strategies

### Iterative Pre-Dump Strategy
1. **Multiple Pre-Dumps** - Transfer memory incrementally over time
2. **Change Tracking** - Monitor which pages change between pre-dumps
3. **Final Checkpoint** - Quick final dump with only changed pages
4. **Fast Restore** - Rapid service restart on target system

### Lazy Migration Strategy
1. **Page Server Setup** - Start page server on source system
2. **Minimal Restore** - Start service quickly with essential pages only
3. **On-Demand Loading** - Fetch additional pages as needed
4. **Gradual Warming** - Service performance improves as pages load

### Hybrid Approach
Combine both strategies for optimal results based on application characteristics.

## Infrastructure Coordination

### Load Balancer Management
- **Health Check Coordination** - Configure health checks for migration
- **Traffic Draining** - Gradually reduce traffic to source service
- **Cutover Timing** - Switch traffic at optimal moment
- **Rollback Preparation** - Plan for quick rollback if needed

### Monitoring Integration
- **Migration Metrics** - Track migration progress and performance
- **Service Health** - Monitor service health throughout migration
- **Alert Coordination** - Manage alerts during migration window
- **Performance Validation** - Verify service performance post-migration

## Quick Implementation

1. **Pre-Migration Assessment** - Evaluate service characteristics and requirements
2. **Strategy Selection** - Choose optimal migration strategy for workload
3. **Infrastructure Preparation** - Configure load balancers and monitoring
4. **Migration Execution** - Execute chosen strategy with proper coordination
5. **Post-Migration Validation** - Verify service health and performance

## Downtime Minimization Techniques

### Application-Level Preparation
- **Connection Draining** - Allow existing connections to complete
- **State Externalization** - Move critical state to external stores when possible
- **Graceful Shutdown** - Implement proper shutdown procedures
- **Health Check Updates** - Update health checks for migration readiness

### System-Level Optimization
- **Pre-Dump Scheduling** - Schedule pre-dumps during low-activity periods
- **Network Optimization** - Use high-bandwidth connections for data transfer
- **Storage Performance** - Use fast storage for checkpoint data
- **Resource Allocation** - Ensure adequate resources on target system

## Migration Timing

### Optimal Windows
- **Low Traffic Periods** - Schedule during minimal user activity
- **Maintenance Windows** - Coordinate with planned maintenance schedules
- **Business Hours Consideration** - Avoid peak business hours when possible
- **Time Zone Awareness** - Consider global user base timing

### Emergency Migration
- **Failure Response** - Rapid migration during system failures
- **Security Incidents** - Quick workload isolation during security events
- **Resource Exhaustion** - Emergency migration when resources depleted
- **Performance Degradation** - Migration to resolve performance issues

## Success Metrics

### Downtime Measurement
- **Total Downtime** - Measure actual service unavailability
- **User Impact** - Track user-visible service interruption
- **Connection Recovery** - Monitor connection reestablishment time
- **Performance Recovery** - Measure time to full performance restoration

### Migration Efficiency
- **Data Transfer Rate** - Measure checkpoint data transfer speed
- **Checkpoint Size** - Track size of checkpoint data
- **Resource Utilization** - Monitor CPU, memory, and network usage
- **Error Rates** - Track migration failures and retry requirements
