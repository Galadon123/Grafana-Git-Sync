# Migration Testing and Validation

## What We'll Learn
How to validate Cedana migration operations through systematic testing approaches covering functional, performance, and integration scenarios.

## Core Concepts

Testing migration operations involves multiple validation layers:
- **Functional Validation** - Does the restored process work correctly?
- **State Preservation** - Is internal application state maintained accurately?
- **Performance Impact** - How do checkpoint/restore operations affect performance?
- **Integration Testing** - Do complex multi-component scenarios work?

## Testing Approaches

### Process State Validation
- **Memory State** - Verify in-memory variables and data structures
- **File Descriptors** - Confirm open files and network connections
- **Signal Handlers** - Test signal processing after restore
- **Threading State** - Validate multi-threaded application behavior

### Container Integration Testing
- **Service Continuity** - Web servers and API services maintain functionality
- **Data Persistence** - Database containers preserve data integrity
- **Network Connectivity** - Container networking works after restore
- **Resource Allocation** - CPU, memory, and storage allocations preserved

### Performance Testing
- **Checkpoint Speed** - Time required for different workload sizes
- **Restore Performance** - Recovery time for various application types
- **Memory Overhead** - Additional memory usage during operations
- **Storage Impact** - Checkpoint file sizes and I/O patterns

## Validation Strategies

### Automated Test Suites
- **Unit Tests** - Individual checkpoint/restore operations
- **Integration Tests** - Multi-container and distributed scenarios
- **Regression Tests** - Ensure new changes don't break existing functionality
- **Load Tests** - Performance under various system loads

### Manual Validation
- **Application Functionality** - End-to-end user workflow testing
- **Data Integrity** - Manual verification of critical data preservation
- **Error Scenarios** - Testing failure modes and recovery procedures
- **Cross-Platform** - Validation across different environments

## Common Test Scenarios

### Web Application Testing
- Start web server, add session data, checkpoint, restore, verify sessions
- Test connection handling and request processing continuity
- Validate database connections and transaction state

### GPU Workload Testing
- CUDA application state preservation across checkpoints
- GPU memory allocation and computation state validation
- Multi-GPU scenarios and device affinity testing

### Kubernetes Pod Testing
- Pod lifecycle management during migration
- Service discovery and networking validation
- Persistent volume attachment and data access
