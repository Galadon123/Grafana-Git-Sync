# Memory Optimization Techniques

## What We'll Learn
How Cedana uses pre-dump and incremental techniques to minimize downtime during checkpoint operations.

## Core Concepts

For processes with large memory footprints, traditional checkpointing can take a long time. Cedana implements optimization techniques:
- **Pre-Dump** - Copy most memory while process continues running
- **Incremental Dumps** - Only save changed memory pages in final checkpoint
- **Memory Tracking** - Monitor which pages have been modified

## How Pre-Dump Works

The pre-dump process:
1. **First Pass** - Save current memory while process runs normally
2. **Track Changes** - Monitor which memory pages get modified
3. **Final Dump** - Only save changed pages (much faster)
4. **Combine** - Restore uses both pre-dump and final dump data

This dramatically reduces the time the process is paused.

## When to Use

Pre-dump optimization is valuable for:
- **Large Memory Processes** - Applications using multiple GB of RAM
- **Live Migration** - Moving services with minimal downtime
- **Critical Applications** - Where pause time must be minimized
- **Network Migration** - Transferring data over slower connections

## Quick Implementation

1. **Pre-Dump Phase** - `cedana pre-dump --pid <PID> --images-dir ./predump1`
2. **Optional Repeat** - Multiple pre-dumps for very large processes
3. **Final Checkpoint** - `cedana dump --pid <PID> --prev-images-dir ./predump1`
4. **Restore** - Uses combined data automatically

Pre-dump can reduce checkpoint downtime from minutes to seconds for large applications.
